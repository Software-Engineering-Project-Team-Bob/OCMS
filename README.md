Online Class Management System (OCMS)
You need to build a web-based class management system like MS Teams which will majorly 
comprise of two major use cases: Students and Professors. The main focus for the software will 
be uploading lectures, implementation of live classes is a bonus. The class management 
system should take care of the following: 

● Have a login for students and professors, both of these use cases will have different 
functionalities. 

● Create virtual ‘classrooms’ in which students have to attend classes during the 
scheduled hours which will have a messaging interface in which students can ask 
doubts. 

● A file-sharing system where only the Professor can upload video lectures, assignments 
and class tests. And the students added to that classroom will have access to these 
files. 

● A personalised Calendar for Professors and Students alike will prompt the user to attend 
classes and show the schedule of the day/week. 

● Each student will have a Grades tab for each subject, which will contain evaluated 
submissions by Professors or TAs. 

We have 2 major use cases, namely Professors and Students. The basic functionalities for each 
of them are -
Professors: 
1. Create Classes that they are supposed to take and add existing students (whose login 
ID exists) to their respective Classrooms. 
2. Schedule the timetable of their classes, which will be linked with all the students are 
added to the classroom. 
3. Option to upload video lectures, Assignments, and Tests, which when uploaded a 
notification should be sent in the messaging interface about the upload. 
4. Option to allot TAs (which are students) that can also upload files, and video lectures (for 
eg: lab demonstration) and evaluate the submission. 
Students: 
1. Option to download the video lectures, Assignment (Pdf or Docx format), and Class tests 
(Pdf or Google form link)
2. Check his/her Grade sheet card which will contain marks of assignment and class test 
along with the name who has evaluated it. 
3. Option to upload Assignment before the deadline, which will be hidden from all other 
participants except the Professors and TA.
